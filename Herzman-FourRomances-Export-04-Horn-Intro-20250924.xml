        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

      <div type="text">
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="1">Written in the last part of the thirteenth century, <hi
            rend="italic">King Horn</hi> is probably the oldest surviving Middle English
            romance.<note target="#1" type="footnotelink">1</note> While <hi rend="italic"
          >Horn</hi>’s meter may show some influence from the rhyming ballad meters of Anglo-Norman
          poetry, it is just as likely that the poem retains characteristics of Old English verse in
          a century when French-speaking Normans dominated English culture.<note target="#2"
            type="footnotelink">2</note> Like Old English verse, its meter depends on several heavy
          stresses per line, though rhymed couplets have overshadowed the alliteration common to
          earlier English poems. Even though an Anglo-Norman poem, <hi rend="italic">Horn </hi><hi
            rend="italic">et Rimenhild</hi>, contains roughly the same plot, some scholars believe
          that the English poem derives from an earlier source.<note target="#3" type="footnotelink"
            >3</note> Both <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Havelok the Dane</hi>
          belong to a group of poems known as the Matter of England, late medieval romances based in
          part on the oral folk culture that survived the Norman Conquest. This category also
          usually includes <hi rend="italic">Athelston</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bevis of
            Hampton</hi>.</p>
        <p style="body" n="1"><hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi> begins with the death of the hero’s
          father at the hands of the Saracens who send Horn and his companions into exile. The young
          Horn finds himself with his twelve companions abandoned in Westernesse (identified with
          the Wirral peninsula near modern-day Liverpool). There the king’s daughter, Rymenhild,
          declares her passion for Horn, and persuades her father to make him a knight. But Horn
          will not marry her until he has proved his worthiness, which he does by killing some
          invading Saracens. Jealous of his exploits, Horn’s companion Fikenhild tells the king that
          Horn plans to kill him. Horn goes into exile again, this time in Ireland where he proves
          his military skill further by killing yet more invading Saracens. Though King Thurston
          offers his daughter Reynild in marriage as a reward, Horn remains loyal to Rymenhild. He
          returns in disguise when she is about to be forced into marriage with one King Mody, but
          then goes off to defeat the Saracens who murdered his father. When he returns he discovers
          that the evil Fikenhild has just forced Rymenhild to marry him. Horn quickly kills the
          traitor comrade, and he and Rymenhild then marry. Reynild, Thurston’s daughter, is given
          in marriage to Horn’s faithful comrade, Athulf, and everyone lives happily ever after.</p>
        <p style="body" n="2">Unlike the loosely organized compositions of many French romances, <hi
            rend="italic">King Horn</hi> uses repetition to create a rather tight, symmetrical
          structure. One may see this repetition on the simplest level, as in two-or-three word
          formulas, recaps of earlier parts of the story, and even large parallel portions of the
          plot. This structure of repetition and parallel helps underscore a major theme of the
          romance — the development of the hero towards maturity. Horn begins as a frightened noble
          child who develops a love life, achieves several military victories, becomes a
          sophisticated strategist with his use of disguises and coded statements to Rymenhild, and
          ultimately wins back his love and his kingdom, both of which have been taken away from him
          unjustly. Georgianna Ziegler identifies four distinct stages in this development:
          destruction (lines 1–152), learning (lines 153–756), initiation (757–1008) and
          reconstruction (1009–end).<note target="#4" type="footnotelink">4</note> The three battles
          show Horn’s increased skill and confidence, as do repetition of hunting and love motifs
          and dream symbolism, which mark a “change from boy to man, from innocence to
          self-assertion, from hunted to hunter. . . .”<note target="#5" type="footnotelink"
            >5</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="3">Another theme of the romance is the stark contrast of good and evil.
            <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi>’s moral world divides distinctly between loyal friends and
          evil traitors — the never-failing Athulf vs. that “wurste moder sone” Fikenhild, who
          double-crosses Horn not once but twice. On a larger scale, Horn’s Christian world is
          threatened by the Saracens — usually thought of as Muslims, yet also clearly
          representative of the Vikings; they are an abstract, thoroughly evil enemy that must be
            defeated.<note target="#6" type="footnotelink">6</note> And, of course, Horn does; he
          beats back the threatening hordes, and brutally mows down Fikenhild, hewing him to pieces.
          As W. R. J. Barron observes, English romance heroes such as Bevis, Guy of Warwick, Horn,
          and Havelok are not dealing with a courtly code but “the oppressive forces of a wicked
            world.”<note target="#7" type="footnotelink">7</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="4">Indeed, the fine sentiments of the courtly love code so popular in
          late twelfth-century continental poetry is missing from <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi>.
          Rather than putting the heroine on a pedestal and praising her virtues, Horn is pursued by
          her; his physical beauty sparks a passion for him that drives Rymenhild wild (lines 256,
          300, 956). Nor does the poem contain much reference to the related code of chivalry,
          though Horn does think it unfair for three of King Thurston’s men to fight one
          Saracen.</p>
        <p style="body" n="5">Many of <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi>’s motifs — sea voyages, exile and
          return, revenge and marriage — do belong to romance tradition. The two near or broken-off
          weddings in the poem replay a timeless situation that not only appears in Chrétien de
          Troyes’ <hi rend="italic">Erec et Enide</hi> or Malory’s <hi rend="italic">Le Morte
            Darthur</hi>, but also in modern films such as <hi rend="italic">The Graduate</hi> and
            <hi rend="italic">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</hi>. Some scholars see folk tale
          motifs as even more prominent: the voyages and exiles, yes, but as well Horn’s disguises,
          the symbols of rings and fish, the significance of dreams, even the simple but effective
          patterns of repetition themselves. All this is put together without the digressions and
          interlacing that typify continental romances of this period.</p>
        <p style="body" n="6">The streamlined, folksy directness of <hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi>
          should not fool us, however. The story contains unexplained actions and situations that
          can only be explained because the poet is referring, sometimes incompletely, to folk tale
          sources. One “folk-tale non sequitur” Barron notes is that Horn gives no particular reason
          for hiding his true identity. And John Speirs sees misty connections to mythology in the
          symbol of Horn himself — to the Horn of Plenty and ultimately the Holy Grail.<note
            target="#8" type="footnotelink">8</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="7"><hi rend="italic">Horn</hi> is also an object lesson about loyalty and
          betrayal in a real-world political sense. For Lee C. Ramsay the poem “seems to say that
          internal dissension is the ultimate threat to a state.”<note target="#9"
            type="footnotelink">9</note> Yet <hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi> is not as much a
          “mirror for princes” as is <hi rend="italic">Havelok the Dane</hi>; rather, it is more a
          chronicle of martial and romantic achievement, a chronicle concerned with political
          gains.</p>
        <p style="body" n="8">Finally, the manuscripts in which <hi rend="italic">King</hi><hi
            rend="italic"> Horn</hi> appears say something about how it may have been viewed by
          contemporary readers and listeners. Both <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Havelok</hi> appear, for example, in a Bodleian Library manuscript (Laud Misc. 108)
          whose contents also include popularized saints’ lives, scientific information, and current
          events; perhaps, as Barron observes, these romances along with the Reader’s Digest version
          of contemporary knowledge “would appeal to an audience of limited sophistication anxious
          for instruction and moral edification.”<note target="#10" type="footnotelink">10</note>
          Cambridge Gg.4.27.2 (the manuscript on which our text is based) is an equally diverse
          anthology compiled in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. In it <hi
            rend="italic">Horn</hi> appears with other romances, saints’ lives, a collection of
          homilies, devotional works, didactic narratives, and several miscellaneous items. <hi
            rend="italic">Horn</hi> also appears as the only romance in a third manuscript anthology
          — British Library MS Harley 2253 — this time, with Latin and French verse, religious
          material, and love poems.<note target="#11" type="footnotelink">11</note> These very
          different locations for <hi rend="italic">Horn</hi> suggest a complexity of attraction
          that modern readers need to know about.</p>
