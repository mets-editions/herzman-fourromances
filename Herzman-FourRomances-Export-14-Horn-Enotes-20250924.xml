        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

        <note type="enote" n="1">1–2<space rend="indent1"/><p>A conventional exhortation with strong
            connections to minstrelsy and oral traditions. Hall suggests that the poem “was
            apparently sung, or chanted, or recited . . . such a performance might have masked
            certain metrical irregularities that instantly become evident to a modern prosodist. .
            .” (p. 33). Because nearly every line of the extant texts contains divergent readings,
            Allen posits an “exclusive common ancestor” from which all three derive. This ancestor
            was not the author’s version; it is just possible that it was not written down. She
            offers three reasons for variation in the MS tradition: “1) a later redaction by the
            author; 2) later additions by performers or unprofessional adaptors; and 3) scribal
            corruption” (p. 33). William A. Quinn in <hi rend="italic">Jongleur: A </hi><hi
              rend="italic">Modified Theory of Oral Improvisation and Its Effects on the </hi><hi
              rend="italic">Performance and Transmission of Middle English Romances</hi>
            (Washington: University Press of America, 1982) agrees that King Horn and Havelok were
            both performed rather than read to an audience. As in all oral performances, variations
            occur while the story is being told and metrical irregularities are not as discernible
            to the ear when there are distractions for the eye.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">5<space rend="indent1"/><p>Hall suggests that <hi rend="italic"
              >biweste</hi> is a formality in romance discourse. Direction and precise location are
            problematic in this poem; among the MSS variation on direction is evident. See notes for
            lines 1145 and 1339.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">10<space rend="indent1"/><p>The description of Horn as “fair” is
            important. More frequently are found superlative descriptions of the romance heroine,
            though the Horn poet connects Horn with his mother’s good looks (lines 7–8). Havelok,
            too, is extraordinarily handsome.</p></note>

              the glas; / He was </hi><hi rend="italic">whit so the flur; / Rose red was his
              colur</hi>. Heroes described this way include <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick</hi>
            (line 132), <hi rend="italic">Bevis </hi><hi rend="italic">of Hampton</hi> (line 2675),
            and <hi rend="italic">Ipomadon</hi> (line 5021). Hall points out several passages like
            this used to praise the beauty of women, but has “not found anything quite like it used
            for a hero of romance” (p. 93). See note to line 319.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">27–28<space rend="indent1"/><p>Villains are often placed in
            opposition to the “good guys” in medieval romance. Thus Athulf is named just before
            Fikenhild whose name, deriving from OE <hi rend="italic">ficol</hi>, means
            “deceitful.”</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">34<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Rod on his
              pleing</hi>. Hall notes that “to play almost regularly means to ride out by wood or
            water” (p. 96). But it could also suggest specific leisure time activities of the
            aristocracy such as hunting and hawking.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">41<space rend="indent1"/><p>Fifteen is a favorite number for
            romance writers and probably has numerological significance, i.e., the combination of
            seven (the number of completion) and eight (a number of new beginning). It could also be
            a division between stages of life as seems to be suggested by line 18 announcing Horn’s
            age.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">42<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Sarazins</hi>. This
            is a contested term that could apply to many groups of non-Christian invaders. See Diane
            Speed, “The Saracens of <hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi>,” <hi rend="italic"
              >Speculum</hi> 65 (1990), 564–95.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">48<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Crist</hi>. The first
            mention of the deity, unusual since more often Middle English romances begin with an
            invocation or prayer. According to Allen in “Some Textual Cruces in <hi rend="italic"
              >King Horn</hi>,” <hi rend="italic">Medium Aevum</hi> 53 (1984), 73–77, there are
            “twenty-seven instances where God or Christ is mentioned in one or more of the three
            manuscripts and in only five of them is there consensus of agreement in all three” (p.
            73).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">51<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">The king alighte of
              his </hi><hi rend="italic">stede</hi>. The king’s dismounting is curious here.
            Considering the threat he has just heard, remaining on horseback in a state of combat
            readiness might be a prudent idea. In later romances hand-to-hand combat takes place
            only after an opponent is knocked off his horse. Hall thinks this episode harkens back
            to a pre-Conquest English custom.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">68<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">The fremde ne the
              sibbe</hi>. This is a conventional phrase meaning “no manner of men.”</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">77–78<space rend="indent1"/><p>Godhild’s retreat under <hi
              rend="italic">a roche of stone</hi> may be to a subterranean chamber or cave. Her
            desire to separate herself from the world is an act reminiscent of the desert saints but
            also could be an act of self defense. Godhild is an uncommon name in England and is
            probably derived from the German <hi rend="italic">Gundihildis</hi>.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">105<space rend="indent1"/><p>That Horn is not slain is quite
            extraordinary given his princely position and the possibility that revenge might occur.
            The Greeks did not hesitate to kill Hector’s son during the Trojan War just for this
            reason.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">115<space rend="indent1"/><p>The <hi rend="italic">children</hi>
            (i.e., young knights or squires) are Horn and his companions. At this point, Horn is
            still considered a “child,” not only because of his tender age, but because of his
            impending social, political, and military obligations. For this reason, Lee C. Ramsey,
            in <hi rend="italic">Chivalric Romance: Popular </hi><hi rend="italic">Literature in
              Medieval England</hi>, classifies <hi rend="italic">King Horn</hi> as a “child exile”
            narrative, a story about “growing up in a personal, military, social, and political
            sense” (p. 26). In line 1529 Athulf is called “child” not in the sense of immaturity,

            appropriate for those of lower social status. The English drinking horn was much
            admired. Decorated drinking horns were prized by kings. Ordericus Vitalis’ chronicle of
            an Easter feast held by William the Conqueror describes the French nobility’s
            appreciation for a beautifully decorated English drinking horn. Henry I and Edward I
            were known to possess them. Hall finds it curious in light of these references that
            drinking horns are not mentioned frequently in Middle English literature, though
            Chaucer’s allusion in The Franklin’s Tale suggests its currency in the fourteenth
            century:</p><quote><lg>

            protocol, i.e., his refusal to drink from anything other than the celebratory horn, is
            designed to spark her memory. He, as a fisherman, has returned to check his net to see
