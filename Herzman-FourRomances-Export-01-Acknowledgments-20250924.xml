        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in

        <p style="bodyfirst">Preparing this edition of four romances from the thirteenth and
          fourteenth centuries has produced its own adventures — including journeys by sea, car,
          subway, and bus, the perils of snow, and the languid haze of summer. Through all these
          peregrinations both earthly and editorial, we have relied on the help of numerous
          colleagues, students, friends, and family members.</p>
        <p style="body">In the first place, we wish to thank the Consortium for the Teaching of the
          Middle Ages and all its supervisory members for their help and encouragement. Special
          thanks go to our friends at the Robbins Library, particularly Russell A. Peck for setting
          an editorial standard requiring the best we had to give; Alan Lupack, Curator for
          providing often obscure research materials and for his careful reading of the manuscript;
          Karen Saupe, who as assistant editor of METS in its early days proved herself invaluable
          as troubleshooter, whether giving technical advice about Word Perfect, double-checking
          references on baffling place names, or providing careful editorial scrutiny. So too do we
          wish to thank Dong Choon Lee, for his help checking texts against photocopies of the
          manuscripts, and Mara Amster and Jennifer Church, whose many talents have made the
          camera-ready process infinitely more efficient.</p>
        <p style="body">At Geneseo, we were deeply fortunate to have two of our finest
          undergraduates, Lisa Lucenti and Laura Sythes, read our glosses and notes to provide a
          student reader’s perspective. Marie Henry and Gail English supported us in many ways from
          the English Department Office.</p>
        <p style="body">We also wish to thank some special people in our lives who intersected with
          the production of this volume. Sarah Higley provided an insightful reading of an early
          draft of the general introduction. Graham in particular thanks his sister and
          brother-in-law, Susan Drake Cumbie and Seán Cumbie, for their hospitality in Georgia and
          California while he worked on this manuscript, and his cousins, Donnie and Margaret
          Johnston of Cunningsburgh, Shetland Isles, who provided their American cousin with a quiet
          sitting room to work in and even iced tea (despite their personal distaste for it) during
          a working summer in Scotland. Equally gracious was the hospitality of Mrs. Veronica
          Herzman in Geneseo. Ron would also like to thank Veronica Herzman, though for different
          reasons: recently a favorite student and earlier his most important teacher. In addition
          to the usual gang, Ellen, Suzanne, and Edward Herzman, Wes Kennison, and Bill Cook, Ron
          also thanks two e-mail buddies — Anne Clark Bartlett (who kept telling him how much an
          edition of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> was needed), and Rick Emmerson. Eve wishes to
          thank daughter Meghan for her cheerful optimism and ongoing contributions to a rich and
          diversified domestic life.</p>
        <p style="body">Finally, we are grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose
          support, even in difficult times, has kept the Middle English Texts Series alive.</p>
