        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

        <p style="bodyfirst" n="1"><hi rend="italic">Bevis of Hampton</hi> (c. 1324) is a romance
          that has it all: a hero whose exploits take him from callow youth to hard-won maturity to
          a serene and almost sanctified death; a resourceful and appealing heroine; faithful
          servants and dynastic intrigue; a parade of interesting villains, foreign and domestic,
          exotic and local; a geographical sweep which moves back and forth from England to the Near
          East and through most of western Europe; battles with dragons and giants; forced marriages
          and episodes of domestic violence; a myriad of disguises and mistaken identities; harsh
          imprisonments with dramatic escapes, harrowing rescues, violent urban warfare; and, last
          but not least, a horse of such valor that his death at the end of the poem is at least as
          tragic as that of the heroine, and almost as tragic as that of Bevis himself. Not
          surprisingly, however, this much variety makes the poem a difficult one to characterize
          with any degree of certainty. And several other factors make it a poem which is perhaps
          easier to enjoy than to evaluate accurately.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="1">The Text of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi></p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="2">One of these complicating factors is textual. Unlike the other
          romances in this volume, which survive in only one or two manuscripts, there are six
          manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi>, and the relationship between them is
            complex.<note target="#1" type="footnotelink">1</note> A. C. Baugh’s conclusion is that
          the six extant manuscripts — descended from a lost earlier Middle English version of the
          poem, which in turn is descended from the Anglo-Norman <hi rend="italic">Boeuve de
            Haumton</hi> — are so different from each other that “[i]nstead of speaking of a single
          Middle English romance of <hi rend="italic">Bevis of </hi><hi rend="italic">Hampton</hi>
          it would be more in accordance with the facts to say that we have at least five versions,
          each of which is entitled to be considered a separate romance.”<note target="#2"
            type="footnotelink">2</note> Our decision to edit the A version (the Auchinleck MS) was
          not especially problematic; indeed, it was the obvious decision, since this manuscript is
          recognized as the most complete and also, as scholarly consensus suggests, the best.
          Nonetheless, it is important to be forthright in acknowledging that what we have done is
          present “a” version of Bevis rather than “the” definitive version.</p>
        <p style="body" n="1">The wide variation in manuscripts would certainly seem to be unusual,
          at least from the point of view of somewhat more “canonical” texts — Biblical and
          classical — which were held in such awe by medieval authors that they dared not alter
          them. As Baugh puts it, a “Biblical text was protected by the sanctity of the work, a
          classical text by the fame of the author. One did not try to improve on Virgil” (p. 17).
          What happens when a text is protected neither by sanctity nor sufficient authorial fame?
          Since so many of the Middle English romances survive in only a single manuscript, this is
          not always a relevant question. But, in the case of an anonymous, non-canonical poem such
          as <hi rend="italic">Bevis of Hampton</hi>, its relevance is significant.</p>
        <p style="body" n="2">Baugh’s own explanation for the great differences among the existing
          manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> is that the written texts represent versions
          based on oral recitations from minstrels relying on memory and not unwilling to resort to
          improvisation when memory failed (p. 34). Whether or not one accepts his conclusion, it is
          clear from a comparison of the <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> manuscripts that the vast
          textual differences cannot be accounted for by claiming either scribal variation or
          serendipitous oral performance. Not only are words changed, but entire scenes as well.
          Bevis’ battle with the dragon which likens him to St. George, the patron saint of England,
          and the descriptive urban war in London, for example, do not appear in the Anglo-Norman
            version.<note target="#3" type="footnotelink">3</note> Likewise, from the textual
          evidence available, it is also clear that the lost Middle English original from which the
          Auchinleck manuscript descends was in no sense an attempt to translate literally the
          French of the Anglo-Norman version. Rather, while retaining fidelity to what Baugh calls
          “incident and idea,” the “author” of the original Middle English text felt free to
          paraphrase and even to invent.<note target="#4" type="footnotelink">4</note></p>
        <p style="body" n="3">This brief textual history reminds us that what survives is a <hi
            rend="italic">Bevis</hi> tradition rather than a singular <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi>
          text, though it would be an exaggeration to compare it too closely to a <hi rend="italic"
            >Troilus</hi> tradition, for example. But the way in which the story of <hi
            rend="italic">Troilus and Criseyde</hi> is developed by a writer such as Chaucer can at
          least be suggestive of what we mean here. In composing <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
            Criseyde</hi>, Chaucer meticulously translated blocks of narrative from the Italian <hi
            rend="italic">Il Filostrato</hi> written by his predecessor Boccaccio. Yet much, if not
          most of what he does, is something more than a literal translation of his illustrious
          predecessor, something more aptly described as imaginative recreation. The proportion
          between imitation and individuality is perhaps reversed in the various versions of <hi
            rend="italic">Bevis</hi> — for all their differences, there are still greater
          similarities in the surviving manuscripts than between Boccaccio and Chaucer — and we are
          not claiming that anything like the individual genius of Chaucer (or Boccaccio) has put a
          stamp on any of the later versions of the poem. But the “tradition” of <hi rend="italic"
            >Bevis</hi> apparently continued to interest a wide number of people over a long period
          of time, apart from the authority of any individual text. Baugh writes:</p>
        <quote>The story’s popularity continued on into the sixteenth and even the seventeenth
          century when various early printed editions appeared. Like the story of Guy of Warwick, it
          doubtless owed something of its popularity to national pride, but it is a good story in
          itself and was told three times in French verse, even at great length, to say nothing of
          versions in Celtic, Old Norse, Dutch, Italian, even in Romanian, Russian, and
            Yiddish.<note target="#5" type="footnotelink">5</note></quote>
        <p style="heading" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> as an Episodic Narrative</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="3">A second interesting aspect of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi>
          concerns the shape of the poem itself, more specifically the verse form. The first 475
          lines of the poem are written in six-line tail-rhyme stanzas. Then, for reasons that
          remain unexplained, there is a switch and the rest of the romance, over 4000 lines, is
          written in couplets. Rather than attempt to posit another theory to account for this
          change, perhaps we can do no more than suggest what it points toward, which is the highly
          episodic nature of the work. Dieter Mehl confidently divides the romance into five parts
          of almost equal sections of 900 lines each, and suggests the obvious reason for these
          breaks — ease in recitation at different intervals.<note target="#6" type="footnotelink"
            >6</note> These narrative episodes in <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> are largely
          self-sufficient, without the kind of interlace that is characteristic of, for example, the
          French romances of Chrétien de Troyes in the twelfth century which are carefully conjoined
          both structurally and thematically into the larger fabric of the work.<note target="#7"
            type="footnotelink">7</note> Nevertheless, both the dynastic and the personal
          characteristics of the story are tied up at the end, allowing Mehl to say that <hi
            rend="italic">Bevis</hi> is “indeed a unified whole” (p. 216).</p>
        <p style="body" n="4">While it would be too much even to describe all of the hero’s
          adventures, a brief summary is useful at the outset to provide the reader with the flavor
          of an episodic plot that is so complex as to challenge even the best of memories.</p>
        <p style="heading2" n="1">Episode One:</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="4">Like many of the poems of the thirteenth century, this one begins
          with the death of the hero’s father — Guy of Hampton who, in his old age, decides that he
          needs to produce an heir for his estate. For this purpose he requests marriage to the
          beautiful young daughter of the King of Scotland, who agrees to the suit without his
          daughter’s consent. Thus arranged, the marriage commences and soon Bevis is born. By the
          time Bevis is seven years old, however, his mother has become discontent with marriage to
          a man who spends more time in church than in her boudoir, and she plots his murder. To
          accomplish the deed she sends a messenger to her former lover, the Emperor of Germany,
          with an invitation to invade England and murder Sir Guy. Bevis’ mother then feigns an
          illness which requires, as remedy, the blood of a boar that resides at the agreed-upon
          battle site; persuaded by her imploring rhetoric and her convincing theatrical skill, Sir
          Guy is duped into combat. Caught by surprise and hopelessly outnumbered by the emperor’s
          army, the hapless earl must beg for mercy; the request is honored by immediate
          decapitation. Sir Guy’s head is then sent to Bevis’ mother, who invites the emperor to her
          bedchamber that very night. Soon the conspirators are married.</p>
        <p style="body" n="5">This places Bevis in a difficult position, since he is the rightful
          heir to his father’s earldom; for this reason alone the conspirators would kill him. Yet
          when Bevis, a precocious seven-year-old, calls his mother a “vile whore” and voices his
          wish to have her executed in the most horrible manner, he unwittingly provides his mother
          with additional incentive to destroy him. She commands Saber, his teacher, to kill the boy
          and provide proof of his death. Reluctant to do the deed, however, Saber kills a swine,
          sprinkles its blood upon the boy’s clothes, and vows to send him from harm’s way. Bevis
          takes matters into his own hands; he gains entry into the castle by killing the porter and
          vehemently attacks his stepfather. Outraged, Bevis’ mother requisitions four knights to
          sell the boy to merchants, and soon Bevis finds himself on a ship headed for the Near
          East.</p>
        <p style="body" n="6">Bevis, who seems doomed, finds solace in the Armenian court of King
          Ermin. When the king hears the boy’s woeful story, he welcomes him with the hope that one
          day he will become a devotee to Mohammed and carry the king’s banner in battle. Even when
          Bevis refuses to convert, the king admires him and arranges that the boy be trained in the
          manner of all young Armenian warriors. When Bevis turns fifteen, his training has been
          completed and it is time for his first test of prowess in the field. But before an
          appropriate venue can be found, Bevis is goaded into a defensive attack by an insult made
          by one of the king’s men. The king is not pleased when he learns that Bevis has
          annihilated some of his best men; he would hang him for treason but his beautiful
          daughter, Josian, intercedes, arguing that the novice warrior acted only in self-defense.
          Showing his grievous wounds Bevis again elicits the king’s admiration, and when he
          reverses his judgment, Josian provides medical aid. This marks the beginning of her love
          for Bevis.</p>
        <p style="body" n="7">The episode ends with a battle between Bevis and a vicious, man-eating
          boar. In a contest that takes all day, Bevis finally makes the kill by inserting his sword
          in the beast’s open mouth and carving its heart in two. He then cuts off the boar’s head
          which he initially plans to present to Josian. Those plans change, however, when Bevis is
          attacked by an envious steward and several of the king’s men. In protecting himself, Bevis
          slays his attackers and cuts off the steward’s head. But rather than take the steward’s
          head to the king to expose the steward’s treachery, Bevis delivers the boar’s head in its
          place. Meanwhile, Josian has witnessed the entire event from her tower and falls ever more
          deeply in love with this amazing young man.</p>
        <p style="heading2" n="2">Episode Two:</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="5">King Brademond requests Josian’s hand in marriage, threatening to
          destroy Ermin’s kingdom should he refuse. The act provokes hostilities and provides Bevis
          an opportunity to demonstrate his martial prowess which by this time is fully endorsed by
          Josian. The king agrees to dub the young man and presents him with a special sword named
          Morgelai and an extraordinary horse named Arondel, both of which prove invaluable during
          the course of Bevis’ career. Thus armed and mobilized, Bevis leads a host of thirty
          thousand into battle against King Redefoun, Brademond’s ally; sixty thousand Saracens are
          slain. When Brademond witnesses the carnage he flees, only to be caught and challenged to
          hand-to-hand combat with Bevis himself. When Brademond realizes that this battle could be
          his last, he cries for mercy. But rather than cut off his head, as the Emperor of Germany
          had done to his father, Bevis extracts, instead, Brademond’s promise of homage to King
          Ermin.</p>
        <p style="body" n="8">When Bevis returns to the victory celebration, Josian declares her
          love for him. But Bevis is taken aback by her assertive behavior and declines her
          willingness to submit to him in any way. Angry and frustrated at his rejection, she calls
          him a churl, an insult to which he responds by retreating to the nearest inn. Not easily
          dissuaded, however, Josian sends her messenger, Bonefas, with an apology. In
          acknowledgment Bevis sends her a white silk mantle, the extravagance of which compels
          Josian to seek him out herself. Reluctant to talk with her, however, Bevis feigns sleep,
          but Josian persists and in a desperate plea for his love, pledges conversion to
          Christianity. At this magnanimous gesture, Bevis acquiesces and they seal their
          reconciliation and future together with a kiss. Meanwhile, smoldering with anger and envy,
          Brademond starts a rumor that Bevis has deflowered Josian; when her father hears it, he
          orders Bevis to take a letter to Brademond demanding Bevis’ death; the newly dubbed knight
          is ordered to leave his sword and horse at home. Meanwhile, back in England, Saber sends
          his son, Terri, to find Bevis.</p>
        <p style="body" n="9">Terri’s search takes him all over Europe and the Middle East where he
          soon meets Bevis while both are seeking repose under a tree one day. Terri, who has never
          met the man he has been sent to find, does not recognize Bevis. But when he asks this
          stranger whether he has heard about a child sold to the Saracens, Bevis reveals his
          identity and a nostalgic scene ensues; it is followed by a brief discussion of the letter
          Bevis is delivering to Brademond. Bevis knows nothing of its contents and suspects neither
          the king’s betrayal nor Brademond’s treacherous motives. Before they part, Bevis requests
          Terri to take a message to Saber to spread a rumor in England that he is dead. Terri
          agrees and they separate, going in opposite directions. When Bevis reaches Damascus he
          commits an impious act against the Saracen gods (throws them in the dirt) before
          presenting himself to Brademond. When Brademond reads King Ermin’s letter of betrayal, he
          personally restrains the young man while his men subdue him and cast him into a pit twenty
          fathoms deep. In this deep, dark prison Bevis is bound to a great stone and fed only bread
          and water.</p>
        <p style="body" n="10">The scene then switches to Josian who does not know what her father
          has done. When she asks Bevis’ whereabouts, he tells her that her beloved has married an
          English princess; Josian is grief stricken. This is the point at which King Yvor enters
          the narrative by proposing a marriage suit that is almost immediately granted by Josian’s
          father. Yvor not only acquires Josian in this deal, but also Arondel, Bevis’ wonder horse
          which Yvor soon discovers can be ridden only by one man. When he is unceremoniously
          thrown, Yvor commands that Arondel be fettered and chained in a manner reminiscent of
          Bevis’ punishment. Meanwhile, back in his pit, Bevis is attacked by a venomous snake that
          scars his forehead for life. Now in his seventh year of imprisonment, Bevis is so
          overwhelmed by despair that in desperation he prays for help; shortly thereafter there
          appears an opportunity to dispatch his wardens. Another prayer frees him from the great
          stone and he climbs out of the prison, rearms himself, and finds a horse to make his
          escape. He dupes the porter into opening the castle gates and rides until he can ride no
          farther. Then in a state of utter fatigue he falls asleep and dreams that Brademond and
          seven kings are about to kill him. Startled into wakefulness he rides like a madman until
          inevitably Brademond’s search party catches up with him. One of the kings in the group,
          King Grander, challenges Bevis to combat and soon loses his life. Bevis quickly
          confiscates Grander’s horse, Trenchefis, and with Brademond’s men in hot pursuit, horse
          and rider leap into the sea and swim for their lives.</p>
        <p style="heading2" n="3">Episode Three:</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="6">What would seem to be a trivial event launches the third episode
          — when Trenchefis arises from the sea, shaking himself dry, he inadvertently throws the
          enervated Bevis to the ground which jars the knight’s memory of the horse he left behind.
          This remembrance spurs him to continue riding until he finds a town that he soon discovers
          is under siege by a giant, the brother of King Grander. When the giant recognizes Bevis’
          steed as his brother’s, he attacks and accidentally kills his brother’s horse. Horseless
          and wounded, Bevis prevails nonetheless, liberating the townspeople by defeating their
          oppressor. Grateful, they tend to his wounds until he is ready to continue his journey. On
          the way he stops off in Jerusalem to visit with a patriarch who tells him to marry no
          woman unless she is a virgin. This reminds Bevis that he has also left Josian in Armenia,
          a memory that triggers an adjustment to the purpose of his journey.</p>
        <p style="body" n="11">When he arrives at the Armenian court he learns that Josian has been
          married off to King Yvor, who has also acquired Morgelai and Arondel. This triple affront
          prompts Bevis to press on to Mombraunt, Yvor’s stronghold, with intent to recuperate his
          losses. When he arrives, Yvor is out hunting whereupon Bevis disguises himself as a beggar
          to gain an audience with Josian, who has already acquired a reputation for generosity
          toward the needy. When she asks the homeless and transient group before her whether anyone
          has heard about a man named Bevis, Bevis, in disguise, replies in the affirmative. But
          before revealing his identity he arranges to see the imprisoned wonder horse. When Arondel
          shows signs of immediate recognition, Josian realizes who the pilgrim is and reminds Bevis
          of their tacit betrothal. But since she is already married and presumably not a virgin
          anymore, Bevis rescinds his commitment. Josian persists in her claim that she has remained
          a virgin despite her marriage to Yvor and dares him to find anyone to prove otherwise.
          Meanwhile, her servant Bonefas strongly urges escape since the king is expected back at
          any moment. Yvor soon arrives but when he is told that his brother, the King of Dabilent,
          is under siege, he bequeaths guardianship of the city to Garcy, an elderly king, and
          departs. Bevis and his cohorts drug Garcy in order to escape. But because Garcy is a
          necromancer he can see in his magic ring where they have gone and instructs a formidable
          giant named Ascopard to track them and kill Bevis.</p>
        <p style="body" n="12">Meanwhile, Bevis and company hide in a cave where they soon grow very
          hungry. When Bevis goes out to hunt, leaving Bonefas and Josian alone, they are attacked
          by two ferocious lions. The beasts kill Bonefas and his horse, but leave Josian, who is
          protected by her virginity, unharmed. When Bevis returns, he too is attacked and when
          Josian offers to help him fight, Bevis refuses for the insult to his masculine pride. He
          gets wounded in a prolonged fight but finally defeats both lions. Bevis sets Josian upon a
          mule, and they ride forth. Soon they meet Ascopard whose ambush provokes angry retaliation
          from Bevis. Josian intercedes successfully this time and recruits Ascopard as Bevis’ page
          before either is killed. Together the three find a ship filled with Saracens whom Ascopard
          quickly dispatches; he then carries Bevis, Josian and her mule, and Arondel to the ship
          and they sail away to Cologne. There they meet with Bevis’ uncle Saber (not to be confused
          with his teacher back in England) who is a Florentine bishop. Bevis requests that Josian
          and Ascopard be baptized into the Christian faith. Josian willingly accepts, but Ascopard
          rejects the offer, saying that he is too large to fit into the baptismal font.</p>
        <p style="body" n="13">In Cologne there is a dragon whose origin prompts a minor digression.
          The dragon is one of two kings magically transformed after a twenty-four-year battle,
          until a hermit prays for their demise. One then flies to Tuscany where it takes up
          residence under a cliff at Cologne; the other flies to Rome where every seven years it
          raises a stench that makes the local folks sick. Before his battle with the beast of
          Cologne commences, Bevis dreams that he is attacked and covered with its venom. Shaken by
          the premonition, he asks Ascopard whether they should fight the beast together. At first
          Ascopard agrees, but when he realizes the dangers of such an endeavor he declines the
          invitation.</p>
        <p style="heading2" n="4">Episode Four:</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="7">Bevis’ battle with the dragon carries on for days, wearing down
          the hero’s strength. Nearby, however, there is a well made holy, legend says, by the
          bathing of a virgin. The weary and desperate Bevis drinks from the well and calls on St.
          George for help. Miraculously, he regains his strength to continue the fight until the
          dragon spews forth its venom, rendering Bevis’ premonitory dream true. His armor bursts;
          his skin becomes leprous; he cries for divine aid. The third time he is thrown into the
          well, he recovers his courage, his leprous skin is healed, and as a whole man he assails
          the dragon again. The hero soon prevails, cuts the dragon’s tongue out, and displays it
          for the liberated townspeople to see. Then in a quiet moment, Bevis seeks counsel from
          Saber Florentine about his patrimony in England; the bishop advises him to go back and
          fight. Bevis arranges to leave and assigns Ascopard the task of protecting Josian.</p>
        <p style="body" n="14">The scene then switches to Josian who has been admired from afar by
          an earl named Miles. In order to entice Ascopard away from her, the earl sends him a false
          letter from Bevis and when Ascopard is safely removed, Miles forces Josian into wedlock.
          Josian, whose will is not to be taken lightly, murders him on their wedding night before
          the marriage is consummated. The next day her deed is discovered, however, and she is
          condemned to death. By the time Ascopard breaks away from his imprisonment and gets to
          Josian, Bevis is already there; he berates the giant for neglecting his guard duties, but
          after Ascopard offers a rational explanation of events, Bevis’ anger is assuaged; together
          they rescue Josian and sail back to the Isle of Wight.</p>
        <p style="body" n="15">Bevis enters Hampton disguised as a Frenchman named Gerard and
          consults with the emperor about procuring military support in a fight against Saber, who
          by this time has become the emperor’s sworn enemy. The cover story works, and a poignant
          reunion between Bevis and his beloved teacher ensues on the Isle of Wight. Bevis then
          orders a messenger to return to the emperor to disclose his deception. The emperor is so
          enraged by the duping that he flings his knife at the messenger and accidentally kills his
          own son. The messenger then insults the emperor — too much sex has distorted your
          vision!</p>
        <p style="body" n="16">During the culminating battle against the emperor, Bevis soon finds
          himself face to face with his stepfather who is rescued before Bevis can kill him.
          However, where Bevis fails Ascopard succeeds, and he soon delivers the emperor to Saber’s
          castle where he is thrown into a kettle of molten lead. When Bevis’ mother witnesses her
          husband’s gruesome demise, she falls from her tower and breaks her neck. Bevis thus
          regains his patrimony and sends for Josian and his uncle the bishop to officiate at their
          wedding. Shortly thereafter, Josian is pregnant with twins.</p>
        <p style="body" n="17">Bevis requests an audience with the English monarch, King Edgar, in
          order to gain proper recognition of his reacquired estates. The king, impressed with the
          courageous man before him, not only renders approbation but also makes Bevis his marshal.
          The king’s son admires Bevis’ horse, but Arondel kicks him and the prince dies. King Edgar
          is very angry and condemns Bevis to death until his barons convince him that only the
          horse should be put to death. But Bevis would rather relinquish his estates than lose
          Arondel again. So Bevis, the pregnant Josian, Terri, Ascopard, and Arondel leave for
          Armenia. When Terri is made Bevis’ page, Ascopard begins to plot his betrayal.</p>
        <p style="heading2" n="5">Episode Five:</p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="8">King Yvor receives Ascopard and demands that he abduct Josian.
          Ascopard, now a traitor, kidnaps Josian immediately after she has given birth to twin sons
          — Miles and Guy — while Bevis and Terri are off building a hut for her. Her abductors beat
          her with their swords, bind her hands, and carry her away, leaving her infants unattended.
          When Bevis and Terri return, they find the boys alone and soon foster them — one to a
          forester and the other to a fisherman — with instructions to baptize them. Meanwhile,
          Josian makes herself appear leprous so that the king might be more likely to reject her.
          The strategy works: he sends her away into the wilderness with Ascopard as her guard.</p>
        <p style="body" n="18">Bevis and Terri have no idea where Josian has been taken, but come
          across a tournament being fought for the hand of the princess of Aumbeforce. Bevis and
          Terri enter and when Bevis demonstrates his prowess the princess wants to marry him. He
          objects, citing a wife as an impediment to such a marriage, but the persistent princess
          makes him a deal he cannot refuse. They will live in marital chastity for seven years
          after which time consummation would occur. Should Josian return before that time, however,
          the princess agrees to separate from Bevis and wed Terri in his place.</p>
        <p style="body" n="19">Back in Hampton, Saber dreams that Bevis is on his way to the shrines
          of St. James and St. Giles. When Saber’s wife interprets the dream — i.e., Bevis has lost
          either his wife or child — the concerned Saber, with twelve of his knights, initiates
          another search. They discover the castle in which Ascopard has imprisoned Josian; when she
          calls to them from the tower they attack. Saber kills Ascopard in battle, then he and
          Josian alone resume the search for Bevis and Terri. During their wanderings, Saber falls
          ill and Josian supports them both through her minstrelsy. She prays that Saber will be
          healed, and finally he is. They continue on their way and eventually find Bevis and Terri.
          Another poignant reunion takes place.</p>
        <p style="body" n="20">Josian and Bevis are soon reunited with their children, and Terri is
          wedded to the princess of Aumbeforce. Together they help King Ermin battle Yvor. Bevis
          beats Yvor in combat and sends him to Ermin for judgment only to have him ransomed rather
          than executed. King Ermin dies shortly thereafter making Bevis’ son Guy his heir. Together
          Bevis and Guy convert all of Armenia to Christianity, and Saber goes home to England. A
          thief from Yvor’s court steals Arondel, which prompts another of Saber’s premonitory
          dreams, and compels his return to Armenia to retrieve the horse with several of Yvor’s
          knights in pursuit. Bevis’ sons prove themselves in battle and rescue Saber from certain
          death. A confrontation between Bevis and Yvor takes place on a small nearby island.
          Inevitably, Yvor is defeated and Bevis is crowned king of Mombraunt in his place. At this
          point a messenger arrives from England to report that King Edgar has confiscated Saber’s
          son’s land, and Bevis promises to aid Saber in a war against the English king. When they
          arrive, Bevis leaves his army at Hampton, rides to London to make a courteous appeal for
          restoration of the land. The king receives him and is about to comply with his request
          when suddenly dissent erupts from his steward. Proclaiming Bevis an outlaw and a traitor,
          a provocative action indeed, the steward is pursued to Cheapside where an intense street
          battle commences. News that Bevis has been killed reaches Josian back in Hampton, and she
          sends her two sons to avenge his death. Instead, Guy rescues his father with his brother’s
          help and victory is proclaimed. Josian is then brought to London for the celebration.</p>
        <p style="body" n="21">King Edgar offers his only daughter to Miles in marriage. Bevis
          bequeaths his property and earldom to Saber, and, together, Bevis, Josian, and Guy go back
          to Armenia where Guy is king. Bevis and Josian continue on to Mombraunt where they live
          and rule for twenty years until Josian becomes ill. At about the same time Bevis finds
          Arondel dead in his stall. Soon afterward, Josian and Bevis die together in a poignant
          embrace. Guy orders that his parents be interred in a newly constructed chapel dedicated
          to St. Lawrence. He also founds a religious house where songs for their souls and for the
          soul of the great horse Arondel are to be sung every day.</p>
        <p style="heading" n="3">Realism and the Exotic in <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi></p>
        <p style="bodyfirst" n="9">The Anglo-Norman version of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> is, as
          Barron suggests, rooted in the need to establish a native ancestry for a new set of
            rulers.<note target="#8" type="footnotelink">8</note> While this dynastic impulse is
          still surely present in the Middle English versions, with a pre-conquest hero dressed in
          the garb and the virtues of present-day England, the poem’s most characteristic virtues
          have at least as much to do with adventure as with ideology. The incredible geographic
          sweep — which gets more and more misty and impressionistic the farther we go from England
          — is perhaps a way of placing England within the larger rhythms of world history, but it
          is also a way to have adventure on the grandest possible scale. As in the other romances
          in this volume, especially <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi>, there is an intriguing
          combination of the exotic and supernatural combined with very realistic detail, local
          color, and homey touches. In <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi>, miraculous escapes from prison
          are juxtaposed with the naming and the description of actual streets in Cheapside. The
          final set of battles is one particularly impressive example of using local scenes to
          energize the story.</p>
        <p style="body" n="22"><hi rend="italic">Bevis of Hampton</hi> was one of the best known and
          most popular of the Middle English romances (Mehl, p. 211). Yet critical response has not
          always been kind to our hero, whose story seems in part to be a victim of its own
          popularity. In the conclusion to <hi rend="italic">English Medieval </hi><hi rend="italic"
            >Romances</hi>, W. R. J. Barron comes close to damning the poem with only the slightest
          touch of accompanying faint praise, writing that “[t]he English versions of <hi
            rend="italic">Bevis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guy [</hi><hi rend="italic">of
            Warwick]</hi> are competent but somewhat vulgarized, given to the reduplication of
          striking effects, paying lip-service to the hero’s values while almost wholly preoccupied
          by their adventures” (p. 233). This characterization of <hi rend="italic">Bevis</hi> is
          probably both accurate and at the same time unfair. Bevis is first and foremost an
          adventure story. But if the values of the hero are not particularly deep, they are
          nonetheless heartfelt, and expressed with admirable verve. And we should be reluctant to
          underestimate the value of a good adventure story or the difficulty of producing one. Its
          energy and its variety, perhaps more than anything, are what enable modern readers to
          understand its earlier popularity and also to respond to it in the present.</p>
