        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>

          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in

        <note type="enote" n="1">1–6<space rend="indent1"/><p>The invocation is typical of
            tail-rhyme romances. Tr notes the similarity in two ME Breton lays — <hi rend="italic"
              >Sir Gowther</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Emaré</hi>. Chaucer’s The Tale of Sir Thopas
            offers an amusing send up of exhortations to pay attention.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">9<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">A man that ledes hym
              therin</hi>. As Tr notes, <hi rend="italic">man</hi> is dative, <hi rend="italic"
              >hym</hi> reflexive. Thus the invocation requests listeners to pay attention to the
            consequences of disloyalty, a theme that is central to the poem.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">10<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">weddyd
            bretheryn</hi>. Sworn brotherhood or “blood” brotherhood, as it is sometimes called, is
            an ancient custom, whereby men bound themselves with an oath to be faithful to each
            other till death. Herodotus reports, for example, that the Scythians participated in a
            ritual whereby they cut their fingers, let the blood run into a chalice, dipped the tips
            of their swords in the blood, and drank it (see John Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Same Sex
              Unions in Pre-</hi><hi rend="italic">Modern Europe</hi> [New York: Villard Books,
            1994], p. 94). Tr notes that this bond among men was “superior to the marriage tie,”
            evidence of which appears in lines 306–07 when the calumniated queen expresses the
            disparity between these two oaths of loyalty, expecting that the bishop will honor the
            king before he will honor her: <hi rend="italic">He wole doo more for </hi><hi
              rend="italic">hym, I wene, / Thanne for me, though I be qwene</hi>.</p><p
            style="enote-indent">John Boswell also notes the multiple meanings for the term: in
            fact, the relationships called “blood brotherhood,” “sworn-brotherhood,” “spiritual
            brotherhood” and so on, vary enormously from culture to culture (and sometimes within a
            single society) in their mode of formation, in their social, legal, and religious
            significance, and in their personal (e.g., affective) aspects” (p. 272). Sworn
            brotherhood is also a central theme in <hi rend="italic">Amis and Amiloun</hi>, the
            analogue Tr considers so closely related to <hi rend="italic">Athelston</hi>. Elizabeth
            Ashman Rowe sees the phrase “sworn brother” as a cynical substitution for an
            “opportunistic brotherhood” who “join in pursuit of political opportunity rather than
            economic profit” (p. 81). Rowe compares this alliance to the false brotherhood of
            Chaucer’s The Pardoner’s Tale.</p>
        </note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">11<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">That wolden yn
              Yngelond go dwel</hi>. Z emends to <hi rend="italic">wilen yn Yngelond gon dwel</hi>.
            Tr rejects Z’s emendation on the grounds that the “phrase ‘of dyvers cuntre’ [in line]
            20 strengthens the idea of strangers from widely separated parts meeting and joining
            themselves in brotherhood” (pp. 93–94). Because sworn-brotherhood is a central theme of
            the poem, Tr’s return to the MS has been retained. George Taylor, “Notes on <hi
              rend="italic">Athelston</hi>,” suggests that <hi rend="italic">wilen</hi> is preferred
            in line 11, while <hi rend="italic">wolden</hi> is preferable for line 14: “to assume
            that the messengers were foreigners, as does T[rounce] only leads to further
            difficulties” (p. 20).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">17<space rend="indent1"/><p>Wayside crosses were common in the
            Middle Ages, though here there is undoubtedly added religious significance, since the
            poem is preoccupied with ecclesiastical authority, <hi rend="italic">Goddys werk</hi>,
            and the phenomenon of miracle.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">21<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">In book iwreten we
              fynde</hi>. A conventional phrase often repeated in the poem in variant forms, that is
            a probable reason scholars still seek a lost source.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">26<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Athelston</hi>. The
            name could allude to at least three historical persons: Athelstan I, an obscure king of
            East Anglia and Kent in the ninth century, Athelstan II, the Danish prince Guthrum
            conquered by King Alfred and renamed Athelstan at baptism, and Athelstan III, victor at
            the Battle of Brunanburh in the year 937. (See Laura A. Hibbard, “<hi rend="italic"
              >Athelston</hi>, A Westminster Legend,” <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> 36 [1921],
            223–44.)</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">30<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">neyghyd hym
            nere</hi>. The usual meaning of <hi rend="italic">neyghyd</hi>, “to approach,” makes
            “sound sense” according to George Taylor: “Athelston, being the king’s cousin,
            considered it advantageous to be about the Court, and his expectation was realized as we
            see in the vv. following where he succeeds his cousin” (p. 20).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">40<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Eerl of Dovere</hi>.
            Just as Egeland is given the castle at Stone, Wymound is given the castle at Dover, a
            strategically important site.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">43<space rend="indent1"/><p>Stone is on the road from London to
            Canterbury. As F&amp;H point out, nearly all the place names mentioned in the poem are
            on this road.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">47<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Edyff</hi>. The name
            may suggest a tenth-century Anglo-Saxon saint whose veneration continued into the
            fourteenth century. The name might also allude to Edward the Confessor’s
          wife.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">56<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">That noble </hi><hi
              rend="italic">clerk, on book cowde rede</hi>. Literacy in late medieval England meant
            those who could read Latin, i.e., members of the clergy.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">67<space rend="indent1"/><p>Tr draws a parallel between the
            precocious growth of the children in <hi rend="italic">Amis and Amiloun</hi> and that of
            the children here, all of which seems to suggest nobility. The growth of the hero in <hi
              rend="italic">Sir Gowther</hi> is also precocious, but is considered an effect of
            demonic paternity.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">77<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">to boure and to

            The history of this important landmark has been a source for determining the poem’s

            legend of Queen Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor. The story is told in the <hi
              rend="italic">Annales of</hi><hi rend="italic"> Wintonia</hi> as follows:</p><quote>In
            1042 Emma, once known as the Flower of Normandy and the widow successively of the
            English king, Athelred the Redeless (978–1016), and of the Danish conqueror, Canute, was
            living at Winchester. She was possessed of great treasures many of which she gave to the
            great church of Saint Swithin whose bishop Alwyn was her most familiar friend. To her
            English sons, Athelred, Alfred and Edward, later known as the Confessor, she had given
            little or nothing, all her favor having been lavished on Harthacnut, her son by Canute.
            When, therefore, Edward came to the throne in 1042, he showed her no honour. Instead he
            surrounded himself with those Norman friends who had aided him in his long exile, and
            among them he especially honoured Robert of Jumieges whom he made Bishop of London and
            afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. The king was a man of wonderful simplicity and at
            last he would believe Robert even if the latter told him a black crow was white. In time
            Robert poisoned Edward’s mind against the good bishop Alwyn and Queen Emma.</quote>
          <quote><space rend="indent1"/>The queen, who was imprisoned at Wherwell, promptly wrote a
            letter to those bishops whom she could trust and begged them to persuade the king that
            she might clear herself by an ordeal to take place at Saint Swithin’s. In a long speech
            which uninvited he made to the bishops, Robert accused the queen not only of evil
            conduct with Alwyn but of having consented to the murder of Alfred, the king’s brother,
            and of having planned to poison the king himself.</quote>
          <quote><space rend="indent1"/>On the day of the trial a great concourse of people gathered
            in Saint Swithin’s church where in a row were placed nine red hot plough-shares. The
            queen, who had passed the previous night in prayer before the shrine of Saint Swithin
            and had been comforted by beholding the saint in a dream, walked forth bravely. Having
            cast off her mantle she closed her eyes and was led by two bishops across the burning
            metal while the people cried aloud: “Swithune, Sancte Swithune, tu illam adjuva!”
            Unconscious that she had passed the ordeal the queen opened her eyes and beheld the
            miracle. She prayed to be taken to the king who, overwhelmed with holy penitence, lay
            prostrate on the floor. Willingly he confessed his fault, willingly he restored Bishop
            Alwyn to highest favor. Joyous was the tumult of the people.</quote>
          <quote><space rend="indent1"/>From Dover, where he had waited to hear the result of the
            ordeal, Robert fled to Jumieges where presently he died. In Winchester king and queen
            and bishop vied with each other in giving treasure and manors to the church of the holy
            saint who had saved them all. (As quoted in Laura A. Hibbard, “Athelston, A Westminster
            Legend,” pp. 227–28)</quote>

            ordeal, was a method of testing guilt or innocence by means of direct physical trial.
            The accused was “subject to some physical test, such as the plunging of a hand into
            boiling water” (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>). The result was thought to represent the
            immediate judgment of God. Trial by ordeal was no longer used by the time <hi

            convention. One thinks of a work such as Gottfried von Strassburg’s <hi rend="italic"

            suggests that the scribe may have mistook “sighed” for “sight” (p. 25). But it may mean
            that the baby has dropped into the birthing position.</p></note>

        <note type="enote" n="75">649<space rend="indent1"/><p>The St. Edmund mentioned here is St.
            Edmund of East Anglia. Born of Saxons, raised a Christian, he became king of the East
            Angles in the ninth century. During a Viking raid he was killed either by scourging or
            shot with arrows as tradition relates, or by being offered to the gods in accord with
            Viking ritual practices. His body, later found to be incorrupt, was transferred to
            Bedricsworth (Bury St. Edmunds). In 925 King Athelstan founded a community of priests
            and deacons to take care of the shrine. One of the most famous representations of Edmund
            is in the Wilton Diptypch where he and Edward the Confessor are depicted as two royal
            patrons of England. Together they present King Richard II to the Virgin and Child. His
            traditional emblem is the arrow, the instrument of his passion, but he is occasionally
            depicted with a wolf, believed to have guarded his head after death. See the <hi

            absolution is necessary to eradicate his participation in the death of his unborn son.
