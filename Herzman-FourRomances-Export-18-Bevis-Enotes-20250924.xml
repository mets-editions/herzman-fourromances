        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>
          <p>This text may include corrections made after the original edition went to press in

        <note type="enote" n="1">11<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">schire</hi>. In the
            Middle Ages a shire was a province or subdivision of a county. Many cities in England
            retain suffixes that indicate a seat of government. A modern analogue for shire would be
            county.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">15<space rend="indent1"/><p>As the notes to the other romances have
            reminded us, in Middle English, double and even triple negatives add emphasis. Unlike in
            modern English a double negative does not constitute an affirmative.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">34–42<space rend="indent1"/><p>That the emperor of Germany is a
            former lover as indicated here sets up the unhappy marital relation. The bride, who is
            never identified except as Bevis’ mother, is dissatisfied because her choice of husband
            has been thwarted by her father’s unilateral decision.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">190<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">tresoun mest</hi>.
            Treason in the Middle Ages connotes treachery or betrayal of someone to whom one owes
            loyalty. Treason is thus not only a personal transgression, but a political
            transgression as well.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">202<space rend="indent1"/><p>The earl wears less armor than he
            would if he knew he were facing a combat situation.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">245<space rend="indent1"/><p>The exaggerated number of knights is a
            convention of medieval romance. Often the hero performs superhuman deeds in battle
            killing hundreds and thousands of opponents single-handedly. See line 4532 for the
            extreme instance.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">292<space rend="indent1"/><p>The messenger speaks the words he is
            told to speak, conveying the message verbatim. Messengers play an important role in
            medieval romance; they not only convey dialogue, but act as narrative links. Oftentimes
            the messenger takes the brunt of the recipient’s anger. Bevis himself will play the role
            of messenger later in the poem.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">302<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Vile houre</hi>.
            Bevis calls his mother a “vile whore” and wishes her to be drawn to death. Drawing or
            dragging, usually accompanied by quartering, entailed tying each limb to a separate rope
            then pulling the body in opposing directions by four horses, literally tearing the
            victim’s body into four pieces. The punishment was usually reserved for felons of the
            worst sort.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">310<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">alle wif</hi>. Bevis
            imagines his mother a madame in a brothel.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">320<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">That child she smot
              with hire honde</hi>. One of many scenes of domestic violence. Not recognized by
            medieval law, violence among family members was considered a private matter with parents
            having customary rights to corporal punishment of their children.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">323<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">meister</hi>.
            Although Saber is Bevis’ uncle he is also his guardian, mentor, or, perhaps, teacher,
            which is a common gloss on ME <hi rend="italic">maister</hi>. See also lines 487 ff.
            where Bevis comes to his “teacher’s” defense. Saber’s name may have significance (from
            OE <hi rend="italic">sigebush</hi>, meaning “victory fortress”); Saber is the faithful
            keeper of the estate and the faith, throughout Bevis’ prolonged absence, and ultimately
            becomes earl of Hampshire. He is not to be confused with the bishop of Cologne, Saber
            Florentine, who appears in lines 2926 ff.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">347<space rend="indent1"/><p>Like the huntsman in Snow White and
            various other folk narratives, Saber circumvents the commands of a wicked mother by
            slaying an animal.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">398<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Scherewe</hi>. From
            this term derives “shrew.” In the Middle Ages the term connoted “rascal,” “rogue,”
            “wicked person,” “evil-doer,” and “unruly or ill-disciplined child.” It could also refer
            to an overbearing woman.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">395–99<space rend="indent1"/><p>The role of the porter is often
            stressful in medieval literature since it is he who decides who is worthy of entrance
            into the city or castle.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="15">415–20<space rend="indent1"/><p>Bevis’ novel means of entry defies
            protocol.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="16">454<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Wo hem was for the
              </hi><hi rend="italic">childes sake</hi>. The knights sympathize with Bevis and let
            him go. Perhaps, they are also afraid of him.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="17">496<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">painim </hi><hi
              rend="italic">londe</hi>. The term could mean anyplace outside of Christian Europe.
              <hi rend="italic">Painim</hi> could refer to any group of people not practicing
            Christianity.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="18">497<space rend="indent1"/><p>Bevis’ mother is participating in an
            activity that goes well beyond fostering and is reminiscent of the actions of Joseph’s
            brothers when they sell him into slavery in Genesis. Or perhaps Orestes, when
            Clytemnestra puts him away. Like Orestes, Bevis will return seeking vengeance for the
            murder of his father. Fortunately for him the mother dies on her own so that he is not
            compelled to exact justice for her treason. But he does take care of her lover, his
            stepfather.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="19">515<space rend="indent1"/><p>The trip is given short shrift. In
            the course of two lines, they have sailed out of England and arrived in the Middle East.
            The land, as indicated in other MSS, is called Ermony, which usually refers to
            Armenia.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="20">520–22<space rend="indent1"/><p>The contrast between snow and
            blood as well as the attention to the shoes on Josian’s feet recall fairy tale motifs
            such as those of Cinderella, Snow White, and Rose Red. The allusion would not be
            farfetched since fairy tales and folk tales, then as now, were present in virtually
            every culture in the world. Both genres are integrally related to medieval
          romance.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="21">531<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Mahoun</hi> was a
            common name for Mohammed in Middle English. In the standard Middle English treatment of
            the Islamic people (most often called Saracens in Middle English), he is treated as one
