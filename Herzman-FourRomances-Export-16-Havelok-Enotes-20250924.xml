        <p>The Middle English Texts Series offers a diverse and representative array of literary
          texts that medieval readers in the present-day British Isles would have encountered
          between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. It is committed to making available both
          affordable print and open access editions to scholars, teachers, and students of the
          Western Middle Ages. In its digital publications, the series prioritizes a user-friendly
          interface and viewing options, multiple downloadable formats, enhanced searchability and
          filtering, and accessibility to the widest possible range of users.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <editorialDecl>
        <p>METS takes as its mission the creation of affordable editions that would pass scrutiny
          from the most demanding expert, yet would prove comprehensible, and even enticing, to
          someone who had never read Middle English before. This agenda dictates that METS
          publications offer not a critical edition reflecting all surviving manuscripts, and
          certainly not a diplomatic edition, but a best-text edition, informed by the notes and
          apparatus of earlier editions (where these exist), and by substantive variants from other
          manuscript witnesses. Transcriptions of Middle English texts are lightly modernized to
          ensure a smooth reading experience, while non-English texts preserve both the original
          language and a modern English translation in facing-page format. Each edition offers
          expert assistance with language and lexicon, providing glosses alongside the text(s),
          textual and explanatory notes, elucidation of unfamiliar contexts and traditions, and
          thematic and interpretive possibilities. All editions feature general introductions that
          set the edited text within its own time, place, and traditions, and link it to ancestor,
          congener, and successor materials. All publications contain comprehensive, current
          bibliographies of pertinent scholarship and criticism. House style is adapted from the <hi
            rend="italic">Chicago Manual of Style</hi>.</p>
        <correction>

      <div type="text">
        <note type="enote" n="1">20<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Benedicamus
              Domino</hi>. “Let us bless the Lord.” This is a verse in the Mass not often used in
            literature. The only other literary example known to Sm occurs in Philippe de Thaün’s
              <hi rend="italic">Bestaire</hi>, in which a pearl is a symbol of Christ.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="2">1–26<space rend="indent1"/><p>As in the other Middle English
            romances in this volume, <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi> begins with a formal exhortation
            to its audience. The convention, according to Sm derives from Old French epics and
            romances and consists of four parts: an exhortation to listen, a statement of subject,
            praise of the hero, and a prayer. Sa, on the other hand, links the poem to its cultural
            milieu: “Its Latin subtitle <hi rend="italic">Incipit vita Hauelok quondam</hi><hi
              rend="italic"> rex anglie et denemarchie</hi> must have matched some sort of popular
            realization that Englishmen of the North were in blood half-Scandinavian and that they
            just before the Conquest had actually been part of a dual kingdom of England and
            Denmark” (p. 55).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="3">28<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">That</hi> refers to
            the king; thus, construe lines 27–30 as “It was a king in former days who in his time
            made good laws and upheld them; young people loved him, old people loved him.” Note the
            inverted sentence structure that emphasizes the object “him” twice by giving it
            syntactical priority.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="4">31<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Dreng</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">thayn</hi> are synonyms for a king’s vassals, though connotations may be
            distinct in other contexts, as Sa suggests when he defines a <hi rend="italic"
              >dreng</hi> in Northumbria at this time as “a tenant with military obligations” (p.
            59).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="5">66<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Hunger</hi><hi
              rend="italic"> ne here</hi>. As noted by Sm, <hi rend="italic">hunger ne here</hi> is
            an Old English alliterative phrase used three times by Wulfstan, an Old English writer
            of homilies.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="6">69<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">The</hi>. L: <hi
              rend="italic">Þe</hi>. F&amp;H: <hi rend="italic">Þei</hi>. “They hid themselves and
            kept themselves still.”</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="7">74<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">his soule hold</hi>.
            Sm notes this as an unusual expression which occurs in <hi rend="italic">Ywain and
              Gawain</hi> (line 887) where it refers to the widow’s concern for the soul of her dead
            husband: <hi rend="italic">Upon his sawl was sho </hi><hi rend="italic">ful helde</hi>.
            Athelwold’s loyalty to his own soul is not narcissistic, but virtuous.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="8">79<space rend="indent1"/><p>The source for the passage is Psalm
            146:9: “The Lord preserveth the stranger; he relieveth the fatherless and widow, but the
            way of the wicked he turneth upside down.”</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="9">85<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">Bute it were bi hire
              </hi><hi rend="italic">wille</hi>. This distinguishes rape, which is punishable by
            medieval English law, from consensual sexual relations, though the issue is complicated
            in jurisprudence. The most complete articulation of rape laws is found in the Statutes
            of Westminster in the thirteenth century. Over time secular legislation conflated rape
            with abduction, shifting it from a crime done to a woman’s body to a crime done against
            the peace of the king.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="10">86<space rend="indent1"/><p>As F&amp;H note “even up to the time
            of the Commonwealth, mutilation was a legal punishment; it was occasionally forbidden,
            but continued to be practiced” (p. 77). Public punishment such as flogging, drawing and
            quartering, and various forms of mutilation often depicted graphically by romancers were
            thought to be a deterrent to crime in real life.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="11">27–86<space rend="indent1"/><p>Sm notes these lines as an
            extensive example of a traditional eulogy of kings such as William the Conqueror and
            Henry I found in the <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</hi>.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="12">89<space rend="indent1"/><p><hi rend="italic">folc ut lede</hi>.
            The sense of folc is “army.”</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="13">87–90<space rend="indent1"/><p>Sm notes the recurrence of these
            four lines in the account of King Arthur in the <hi rend="italic">Anonymous Short
              English Metrical Chronicle of </hi><hi rend="italic">England</hi>. He surmises that
              <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi> was the source for the chronicle repetition and not
            vice versa.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="14">94<space rend="indent1"/><p>To the victor belong the spoils. The
            victorious army carried off plunder, particularly valuable horses and armor. As F&amp;H
            note, “the practice was deplored by moralists as unchristian, but is a matter of course
            in the romances” (p. 78).</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="15">137<space rend="indent1"/><p>On the dying of a king F&amp;H write:
            “When a king was dying, the great nobles hastened to the capital, either out of sympathy
            or a wish to maintain order and look after their interests in arranging for a successor.
            The romancers made a conventional scene of this” (p. 79). It is important to note that
            King Athelwold has no male heir to maintain the peace he has established.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="16">139<space rend="indent1"/><p>Roxburgh, a fort on the Scottish
            border, was often contested by opposing armies and changed hands frequently. Dover, on
            the southeast coast of England, is famous for its “white cliffs.” Traveling from
            Roxburgh to Dover would mean traversing the whole length of England. See also line
            265.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="17">158<space rend="indent1"/><p>Winchester was the Anglo-Saxon
            capital of England before the center of government was relocated in London. Important
            legislation in the poem, however, is enacted in Lincoln, the probable home of the
            poet.</p></note>
        <note type="enote" n="18">188<space rend="indent1"/><p>F&amp;H gloss <hi rend="italic"
              >corporaus</hi> as fine linen cloth. We have placed emphasis on its purpose rather

            fundamental units of a castle or noble dwelling that persisted in some form throughout

            convening of nobles; the bower was a relatively more secluded area used for sleeping.
            The bower, it should be noted, was not necessarily a more private place. Yet the
            association of bower with ladies and hall with knights is appropriate; while one could
            find either sex in either place, the bower is associated more with the more intimate

            have been attached to the nail in line 2479. Chains were used to hang for a long time”

              rend="italic">Seint Davy</hi>. St. David, the sixth-century patron saint of Wales
            whose cult, most evident in the city of the same name, nonetheless spread to other
            ecclesiastical centers (Sherborne, Glastonbury, and Salisbury). Sm finds it curious that
            this particular saint should be invoked in this particular English poem and wonders how
            the poet came to know St. David. The answer, he says, is “to be sought in certain Welsh
            connections of the cathedral and the monastic community of Lincoln. The prominent Welsh
            writer and churchman Giraldus Cambrensis, who wrote a <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> of St.
            David, had withdrawn from court life after 1194 to go and study at Lincoln under William
            of Leicester (then Chancellor of Lincoln), and was there from at least 1196 to 1198. . .
            . It does not necessarily follow that the author of <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi> had
            read Gerald’s <hi rend="italic">Vita</hi> (or any other). But it does seem likely that
            he was in some fashion exposed to the ecclesiastical interest in St. David at Lincoln,
            and therefore he may have lived in Lincoln (as is also suggested by the signs that he
            knew the city at first hand)” (pp. 154–55).</p></note>
